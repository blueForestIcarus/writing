# When in the ocean am I

I have not seen this beach before.
Or perhaps I have, and the seas have moved around the sands

## Is this high tide or low?

Either way, I have no mark to go by.

I suppose I could wait; see where the water is going.
But the waves make it hard to say:
    where the water is
    where the water was
I will have to wait longer.

But even then, I will not know what tide it is.
I will no know, for example, how far the water will move.
