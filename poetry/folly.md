# Folly

I cannot hear and cannot see
my thoughts fading to darkness 
and at last the truth that I
may die, arrives in perfect clarity

and perfect silence, falling from the world.
i draw my last cerebral breath to say
so be it

and before that void into which I'm cast,
two questions do I choose to ask
was it so my broken soul
and all those I looked down upon as fools,
in the end,
were they merely wiser fools than I.
