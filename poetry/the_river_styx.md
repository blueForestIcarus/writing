# The River Styx

3 times he raised his voice  
3 times he spoke freely  
and 3 times his words rang out  
against the face of tyranny  

&emsp; but on the fourth, when he thought he'd won  
&emsp; they took him out and he was done  

&emsp; and just like the rest throughout all time  
&emsp; the people say "he crossed the line"  

&emsp; because if not, why let him speak  
&emsp; the first three calls from out his beak  

&emsp; and those that know, they will remember  
&emsp; dull your words and ease your temper  

&emsp; and 2000 times they'll hush their voice  
&emsp; 2000 times, they'll speak discretely  
&emsp; and 2000 times they'll pull their blows  
&emsp; against the face of tyranny
