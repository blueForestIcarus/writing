# The River Styx

3 times he raised his voice
3 times he spoke freely
and 3 times his words rang out
against the face of tyranny

but on the fourth, when he thought he'd won
they took him out and he was done

and just like the rest throughout all time
the people say "he crossed the line"

because if not, why let him speak
the first three calls from out his beak

And those that know, they will remember
dull your words and ease your temper

and 2000 times they'll hush their voice
2000 times, they'll speak discretely
and 2000 times they'll pull their blows
against the face of tyranny
