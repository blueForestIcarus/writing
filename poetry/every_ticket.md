If we lived, in a world
with respect, for mankind.

Then you'd get, for each ticket
and dollar, you fine.

A gun drawn, to your head.
In that same, sort of way

To the guns, you have drawn,
to our heads, every day.

And they'd say "no you don't"
"not today, don't you dare"

And you'd both, walk away,
it would be, rather fair.

And despite, what you think,
the world'd be, quite the same.

Except there'd be far less problems,
with no-one to blame.
